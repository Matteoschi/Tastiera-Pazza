# Matteo Renzi Reference - Italian Culture Sound Keyboard

## Overview

This project is a simple web-based virtual keyboard that plays sounds inspired by Italian culture when keys are pressed. The keyboard is arranged with buttons representing letters, and clicking any button triggers a corresponding audio clip. The interface is straightforward and minimalistic, designed to provide an engaging and playful way to experience iconic sounds related to Italy, centered around a humorous reference to Matteo Renzi.

## Features

- **Visual Keyboard Layout:** The webpage displays a virtual keyboard with keys arranged in three rows (`sopra`, `medio`, `sotto`) plus special function keys (`ALT` and `SHISH`).
- **Sound Playback:** Each key, when clicked, plays a unique audio clip that represents a sound from Italian culture, adding a cultural and humorous flair to the interaction.
- **Interactive Header:** Clicking the header title also plays an audio clip, enhancing user engagement.
- **Simple and Lightweight:** Built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, no external dependencies are required, making it fast and easy to deploy.
- **Customizable Sounds:** The audio clips can be easily changed or expanded by modifying the JavaScript code to include new sounds or effects.
